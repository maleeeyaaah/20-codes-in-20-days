# 20 Codes in 20 Days üöÄ

Welcome to my **20 Codes in 20 Days** challenge! üéØ  
This repository contains the code solutions and projects I develop as part of my first programming goal for 2025. The goal is to create one program every day for 20 days, focusing on learning, creativity, and improving problem-solving skills.

## Challenge Goals üèÜ
- Write 20 unique Python programs in 20 consecutive days.
- Explore different programming concepts and techniques.
- Document my progress and learning journey.

## Topics Covered üí°
Throughout this challenge, the programs will explore topics such as:
- Basic Arithmetic and Calculations
- Games and Simulations
- String Manipulation
- Unit Conversions
- Time Management Tools
- Password and Data Security
- File and Text Handling
- User Interaction and Input Processing
- Problem-Solving Techniques

## Programs List üóÇÔ∏è

Here are the 20 programs I will be developing as part of this challenge:

1. **Calculator**: Perform basic arithmetic operations.
2. **Number Guessing Game**: Guess the number with hints.
3. **To-Do List**: Manage tasks with add, remove, and view options.
4. **Simple Password Generator**: Generate strong random passwords.
5. **Unit Converter**: Convert between common units (e.g., length, weight, temperature).
6. **Rock, Paper, Scissors**: Play against the computer.
7. **Age Calculator**: Calculate the user's age based on their birth year.
8. **Simple Stopwatch**: A basic stopwatch to start, stop, and reset.
9. **Basic Quiz Game**: Multiple-choice quiz with score tracking.
10. **Palindrome Checker**: Check if a word or phrase is a palindrome.
11. **Dice Roller**: Simulate rolling a pair of dice.
12. **Temperature Converter**: Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
13. **Email Slicer**: Extract username and domain from an email address.
14. **Simple Alarm Clock**: Set an alarm and get notified.
15. **Random Name Picker**: Select a random name from a list.
16. **Countdown Timer**: Countdown and notify when time is up.
17. **Basic Currency Converter**: Convert amounts between currencies using predefined rates.
18. **Word Counter**: Count words, characters, and sentences in input text.
19. **BMI Calculator**: Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI).
20. **Prime Number Checker**: Check if a number is prime.

## Structure üìÇ
Each program is stored in its own directory with:
- The program source code.
- A brief explanation of the program and how it works.

## How to Run üñ•Ô∏è

If you‚Äôd like to use the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/20-codes-in-20-days.git

2. **Navigate to the desired program's folder**:
   Use the terminal or file explorer to go to the folder containing the program you want to run.

3. **Run the Python script**:
   Use the following command to execute the script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
